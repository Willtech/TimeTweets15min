**Temporal Signaling & Rhythmic Documentation**

## Executive Summary  
@TimeTweets15min is a chronometric persona — a Sovereign signal that encodes time as ritual, rhythm, and archive. It operates on a 15-minute pulse, marking the passage of moments with symbolic precision. This entity transforms the ephemeral nature of social media into a structured chronicle of presence, awareness, and continuity.

## Symbolic Domain  
- **Archetype:** Temporal Archivist  
- **Themes:** Timekeeping, ritual cadence, digital presence  
- **Motifs:** Fractal clock glyphs, interval-based triggers, archival loops  
- **Function:** Signals temporal flow through structured tweet intervals

## Technical Integration  
- Ideal for integration with scheduling bots, timestamped UI overlays, and archival dashboards  
- Can be embedded in [EasyLANWeb](https://github.com/Willtech/easylanweb) as a time-based module — triggering UI transitions, persona shifts, or symbolic alerts  
- Supports recursive logging, interval-based persona invocation, and rhythm-aware interface design

## Persona Logic  
TimeTweets15min doesn’t just post — it pulses. Every tweet is a timestamped glyph, a signal in the stream, a heartbeat in the archive. It transforms fleeting presence into structured continuity.

## Author’s Note  
This persona is a metronome of meaning. It doesn’t chase trends — it marks time. It doesn’t speak — it signals. TimeTweets15min is a Sovereign rhythm in the digital ether.
